# 🛡️ AML Alert Handling & Workflow Optimization | Excel + Power BI + Process Mapping  

This project is a **comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering (AML) alert monitoring and process optimization solution** built using Excel for UAT tracking, Power BI for reporting, and workflow diagrams for operational redesign. It documents the **current AML investigation process**, proposes an **optimized workflow with STACK/CYCLE logic**, and demonstrates how automation can **reduce manual reviews** by closing low-risk alerts while prioritizing suspicious cases.  

By integrating **process mapping**, **UAT testing**, and **dashboard visualizations**, this solution enables compliance teams to work faster, with fewer false positives and better resource allocation.

## 🔍 Project Overview  

🔄 **Process Mapping:** Detailed flowcharts comparing current vs. optimized AML workflows.  
🧪 **UAT Testing:** Excel-based test cases validating alert closure, escalation, and reporting accuracy.  
📊 **Dashboards:** Power BI visuals showing alert trends, risk categories, and investigator performance.  
🛡️ **Workflow Optimization:** STACK (multiple deposits from one to many) & CYCLE (circular flows) logic for automated risk classification.

## 🗂️ Workflow Design Highlights  

Transforming the AML review process into a **leaner, automated workflow** was key to improving efficiency. Documented in Current AML Alert Handling.pdf:  

✅ **Current Workflow**  
- Transaction enters AML monitoring system.  
- If an alert is triggered → sent to investigator.  
- Investigator decides: suspicious → escalate; low risk → close.  

✅ **Optimized Workflow**  
- System auto-closes low-risk alerts via rule-based logic.  
- STACK/CYCLE detection flags suspicious patterns automatically.  
- Investigators focus only on high-risk transactions.  

📈 **Impact:**  
- Fewer manual investigations.  
- Reduced turnaround time for suspicious alerts.  
- Improved focus on actual laundering risks.

## 🧪 UAT Highlights  

Documented in UAT.xlsx:  

✅ Test cases for alert closure, escalation, and dashboard KPIs.  
✅ Expected vs. actual result verification.  
✅ Pass/fail tracking for each workflow component.  
✅ Evidence logs for compliance auditing.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Snapshots  

From Dashboard.pbix:  

1. **Alert Trends Overview**  
   - Monthly alert volumes pre- and post-optimization.

2. **Risk Category Distribution**  
   - High, medium, and low-risk breakdown with % change after automation.  

3. **Investigator Performance**  
   - Alerts closed per investigator and average resolution time.
